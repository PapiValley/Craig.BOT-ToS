You agree that the Bot may collect and store data as outlined in our Privacy Policy (such as User IDs and Server IDs) solely for providing its features.

All currency, XP, and items within Craig’s economy system have no real-world value.
We reserve the right to reset or modify economy data at any time due to exploits, balancing, or technical necessity.
